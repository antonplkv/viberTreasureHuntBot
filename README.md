# viberbot
a bot that guides students on a treasure hunt about Oxford.

- sends pictures that don't have any easily identifiable street signs/store names/full landmarks
- students send their location through viber once they have found the place in the picture
- if they found the right place, they get the next clue
- provides students with simple phrases to use in their quest to find the places in the photos
